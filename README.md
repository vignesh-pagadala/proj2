# Worm Propagation Simulator

## About

In this project, we simulate the propagation of a worm in a computer network, and observe the effects after applying a cure. The simulation is initially done without applying a cure, for a network of 500, 1000 and 1500 nodes. We then apply a cure for this network, and observe the behavior.

The following three network topologies are used:

1. Erdos-Renyi
2. Barabasi-Albert
3. Watts-Strogatz

For this simulation, we will be using Python and the networkx package.

### Built With

* Python

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Anaconda distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* Python packages: networkX, matplotlib

### Installation

To install, clone the GitHub repo:

`git clone https://github.com/vignesh-pagadala/worm-propagation-simulator.git`

## Usage

To reproduce, simply run the Python scripts in the /src directory.

`cd src/`

`python Simulation_with_Cure.py`

`python Simulation_without_Cure.py`
